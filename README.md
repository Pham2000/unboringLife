# UnboringLife

A leveling tool that make tedious tasks into enjoyable game. Game of life >:D

## Why?

After playing Wizard101 last night, I started thinking about why it's so fun to kill mobs and level up in the game. Yet, when it comes to working at a job or improving yourself, it often feels boring and tedious, even though we're earning money or gaining knowledge.
That's when I realized: the reason it feels fun in the game is because the results are instantaneous. It feels like you're constantly progressing rather than working toward something abstract or far away.
This led me to think of a way to make everyday tasks feel like they contribute to leveling up your real life.
Introducing the UnboringLife project! :-D
